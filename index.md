## Welcome to iBett

In all honesty there isn't much here. Well in fact, there is nothing here bar this landing page. 

I basically got boared and wanted to mess with GitHub Pages, and I have to admit, it's pretty sweet.

Weird you found but but because you did and the fact you're still reading this, have a scroll below for some fun facts about me. When I say fun...

### Mho am I?

I'm a young 30 somehting IT proffesional based in the north of England, UK. I started work in It when I was around 15 and hav evolved since. I spent many years an an Apple Support Engineer and mainly focuses in the support sector. My main skil was Jamf System Admin, something which took me all over the country at the time.

Over the years I progress further and further that I now manage my own support team. This is good and bad. Good because it's the progression route I wanted, and also bas because it is a lot more hands of in terms of support and tech.

I have recently tried to retrain myself with some skills and learn new skills such as Docker - what a world that is. I struggl with my dyslexia to learn code and command line based things so it has never been easy for me.

Now that's all a bit soppy, I am going to leave you to some more fun...
