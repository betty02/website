## Welcome to iBett

In all honesty there isn't much here. Well in fact, there is nothing here bar this landing page. 

I basically got boared and wanted to mess with GitHub Pages, and I have to admit, it's pretty sweet.

Weird you found but but because you did and the fact you're still reading this, have a scroll below for some fun facts about me. When I say fun...

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/betty02/website/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
